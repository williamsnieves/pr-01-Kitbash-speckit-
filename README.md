This is a web-based 3D scene editor built with Next.js + TypeScript + Three.js.
The project is used to validate the workflow of Spec-Driven Development using Spec Kit.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Spec-Driven Development

This repo follows Spec Kit: PRD → spec → plan → tasks → implementation. Specs live in `specs/`.
